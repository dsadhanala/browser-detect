Browser Detection jQuery Plug-in
================================

Simple browser detection jQuery plug-in, which helps you parse user agent string and fetch the browser information for addressing cross browser compatibility issues.
I would recommend you to try feature detection instead user agent sniffing, however sometimes having browser information handy helps us addressing weird cross browser issues.

There is still some room to enhance this plug-in but for the time being it is good to go!
